Having just moved into a new apartment with a lovely balcony, I felt the time was ripe to try and assess the greenness of my thumb. With spring on the way, and a load of spare wood from an old student house, I set about designing and building an 'urban' garden, with the hope of **perhaps** cultivating something edible.

### Design
Our design was relatively simple; a large rectangular receptacle filled with dirt, raised above the ground to about waist height. Essentially what we planned to do, was build a big table with a box on it. When following this garden design style, the most important points to keep in mind are:

1. The garden needs a drainage system to get rid of excess water. We drilled holes at intervals of 15 cm in a grid over the whole baseboard.

2. The receptacle structure needs to be tall enough to contain 30+ centimeters of dirt, in order for the roots of plants to grow unrestricted. Our design allowed for 40cm of dirt.

3. The structure needs to be strong enough to hold the weight of all the dirt you plan to put in, as well as the plants. It is important to take the **wet** density into account in case of rain, which is higher and thus causes more stress on the frame.

Taking these key characteristics into account, we began the design process. The final design made sure to amply satisfy the above conditions, but was also done taking into account the use of re-purposed wood such as to keep costs minimal.

In the interest of going big enough to cultivate some serious crop, but at the same time keep enough space on the balcony to sit, we decided on interior dimensions of 1200 x 800 x 400. Not filling it all the way to the brim, we allow for 35cm dirt-depth for plants to root down into.

The baseboard consists of 3 parts because.. well, that's what I had lying around! Ideally I would have liked to use more solid, water resistant wood for this section, but it ended up holding quite well as is.

### Construction

Construction went in phases. The two outer rectangles were assembled first, individually. Then we sawed the legs to size and attached each of them to the lower ring of the main box structure. Finally, the leg-corners were cut out of the baseboard, and it was affixed to the main structure with a cross beam. The rings were braced to eachother with vertical metal brackets.

Assembly went rather smoothly, and in the latter phases the process was lubricated by an ample supply of Hertog-Jan. Some small structural issues with regard to the baseboard being too flexible were remedied with an additional thick crossbeam that ran across the bottom width-wise. With the drainage holes drilled, it was time to seal off the inside of the box with an anti-rooting membrane (worteldoek). This cloth was stretched across the interior and nailed into place.

At last, the final test--would it hold the weight of all that dirt?

With an inner dimension of 1200x800x400mm , and assuming a dirt-height of 350mm, we plan to fill the box with approximately 336L of dirt.

$$
1200mm x 800mm x 350mm = 336000000mm^3 = 336L

Assuming densities of approximately 400kg/m^3 (dry) and 1000kg/m^3 (wet),

m_{dry} = .336m^3 * 400kg/m^3  =  134.4kg
m_{wet} = .336m^3 * 1000kg/m^3 =  336kg
$$

In the end, the garden was filled with approximately 300L dirt, which it seemed to hold well. There was minimal bending of the baseboard, and it appeared for the most part to be quite sturdy. It was more important to see how it would fare in the rain however, considering the estimated doubling in mass of the dirt if completely soaked through.

### Planting

The garden was finished just in time to transfer some of the top-performers of our windowsill nursery--we had decided to grow beets, zucchini, tomatoes, carrots, and onions. These were grown indoors until they outgrew pots the size of large coffee cups, upon which we transferred them to the garden.


### Finished Product

And at last, the finished product.

In just 2 months, our little garden went from a patch of dirt to a gladitorial arena of vegetables fighting for sunlight, with the most successful candidates being the tomato shrubs at the back, and the zucchini plants in the front. The garden was only watered occasionally, when it was really too dry.
