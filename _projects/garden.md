Having just moved into a new apartment with a lovely balcony, I felt the time was ripe to try and assess the greenness of my thumb. With spring on the way, and a load of spare wood from an old student house, I set about designing and building an 'urban' garden, with the hope of **perhaps** cultivating something edible. 

### Design
Our design was relatively simple; a large rectangular receptacle filled with dirt, raised above the ground to about waist height. Essentially what we planned to do, was build a big table with a box on it. When following this garden design style, the most important points to keep in mind are:

1. The garden needs a drainage system to get rid of excess water. We drilled holes at intervals of 15 cm in a grid over the whole baseboard.

2. The receptacle structure needs to be tall enough to contain 30+ centimeters of dirt, in order for the roots of plants to grow unrestricted. Our design allowed for 40cm of dirt.

3. The structure needs to be strong enough to hold the weight of all the dirt you plan to put in, as well as the plants. It is important to take the **wet** density into account in case of rain, which is higher and thus causes more stress on the frame.

Taking these key characteristics into account, we began the design process. The final design made sure to amply satisfy the above conditions, but was also done taking into account the use of re-purposed wood such as to keep costs minimal.

### Construction

Construction went in phases. The two outer rectangles were assembled first, individually. Then we sawed the legs to size and attached each of them to the main box structure. Finally, the leg-corners were cut out of the baseboard, and it was affixed to the main structure with a cross beam.

Construction itself went rather smoothly, and in the latter phases the process was lubricated by an ample supply of Hertog-Jan. Some small structural issues with regard to the baseboard being too flexible were remedied with an additional thick crossbeam that ran across the bottom width-wise. With the drainage holes drilled, it was time to seal off the inside of the box with an anti-rooting membrane (worteldoek). This cloth was stretched across the interior and nailed into place.

At last, the final test--would it hold the weight of all that dirt?

- calculate how much dirt, and how much it would weigh
