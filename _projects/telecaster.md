For some reason, classic stratocasters and telecasters always felt very comfortable and playable to me--before long I started considering an acquisition, or better yet, a build of my own!

The assembly itself took place over the course of an afternoon, but parts acquisition was a long and google-intensive process. The end result being a fantastic little blues guitar, with a lot of character.

### Desired characteristics

I decided well in advance that if I was going to assemble a guitar, that I would not go through the effort if it meant ending up with a sub-par instrument. The idea behind DIY is to create something that at least approaches the quality of the original (optimally, surpass), with the additional satisfaction of having done the work yourself, as well as the ability to customise whatever you want.

The things I wanted from this guitar:
- 9.5" Maple neck
- That thick round bluesy tone (Fender Pure Vintage '64 Pickup)
- Old school telecaster bridge

That's about it really, the rest was up to god and Stevie Ray Vaughan.

### Sourcing Parts

Because I wanted a serious instrument, I took my time in sourcing the parts, looking for deals where they came up. Eventually, my attention was drawn to some listings from a fantastic little guitar store in Amsterdam, ![The String](http://www.thestring.com/). The guy who runs this shop periodically buys licensed Fender B-stock necks in bulk from the internet and resells them on the Dutch market for >â‚¬100.

Considering that the 'A-stock' often go for more than $200, this was a great find. The only reason that these necks are labeled as B-stock is because they contain cosmetic 'imperfections' in the wood, which I didn't mind and even found to look pretty cool.

Having looked at elongated pieces of wood for several weeks, I felt it was time to inspect in person, and headed up to Amsterdam. I was given my pick of the litter, and got a chance to look at a bunch of different neck profiles and radii, upon which I found my desired maple neck. As luck would have it, Rienk, the proprietor of the String, had an old authentic telecaster body laying around that had been resprayed white. He was willing to let it go for a decent price and I ended up leaving with a very good body and neck.

Rienk also graciously offered to help me source a bridge, and suggested a Wilkinson variant with brass saddles, which he would procure for me. After not hearing anything for some time, he reached out saying that he hadn't managed to get them, and instead sent me a vintage Fender bridge instead to make up for it!

The pickups I found by exhaustively listening to YouTube videos with different tone, amp, and effect combinations. Eventually, I settled on the Fender Pure Vintage '64 pickup set, which had a really thick and round, but still twangy blues sound to them.

The rest of the electronics were sourced second-hand from marktplaats, or Thomann.

### The Build

Time to assemble! Well, not really. There was one final hurdle to clear, that I would rather let a professional deal with--drilling the neck holes. Without a proper vice and standing drill, I didn't want to take the risk of damaging the neck irreversible, and asked a local luthier to drill the neck holes for me.

With that out of the way however, assembly could actually commence, starting with the wiring.

I used an adjusted version of this wiring layout, due to my switch being a little bit different, but essentially stuck with the "modern" style. Most tele's are wired in this style, since it allows for the individual use of either pickup, or a combination of both. With the "Vintage" wiring, the third setting is an addition neck-only setting, with the treble rolled way down.

The rest, was just a question of putting the right parts in the right places, and triple checking everything before drilling. Getting the machine heads in was a little bit tight, but some careful taps with a (shielded) hammer lead to a snug fit.

With everything in place, all that was left to do was put some fresh strings on, adjust the action, and break out a tasty jam!
