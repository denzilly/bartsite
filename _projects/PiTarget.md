The PiTarget was conceived as a result of my running out of inanimate and/or animate (human) objects at which to fire my newly acquired nerf rifle. Using a Raspberry Pi, the goal of this project is to create a moving target with hit-recognition, as well as evenutally integrate motion detection through the use of a Pi Camera.

The project will proceed in 3 stages, which you can read more about below:

1. [Hit-Detection](https://denzilly.github.io/2019/04/02/Pitarget/)
2. Moving Target (WIP)
3. Motion Detection (WIP)
