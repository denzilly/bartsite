## Background
I am a Dutch economics student that spent most of his time in South East Asia as a kid. While I have a keen interest in economics and financial markets, I am actively looking to develop my data science capabilities by studying python and statistics in my spare time. I have a plethora of hobbies with which to keep myself entertained, which will also regularly be featured as projects that I am working on, or have completed in recent memory.

## Website
Besides functioning as a platform with which to keep my family and friends updated with what I've been doing, this website has also been a great vehicle for me to practice my web development skills. Settling initially on django, I later decided to simplify the concept (since I only display static content), and host this on Jekyll instead.
