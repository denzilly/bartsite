### Time-Travel
In a whirlwind of thunder and lightning, you are sent back in time to 1619--only, unlike in *Terminator*, you get to keep your pants on.

Lo and behold, you kept your smartphone too, and it has an encyclopedia app! Time to educate the locals, instill yourself as a prophet, or perhaps play the tulip markets! You pull it out, and hidden in a dark corner, start browsing only to realise any time-traveler's worst nightmare--5% battery left.

You didn't really pay attention in history class, and suddenly realise your knowledge of economics to be rather limited..but do remember something about building a potato clock, that one time you paid attention in 4th grade. Since the voltaic pile won't be invented for another century-and-a-half, you have little choice! Would it be possible to charge a smartphone with potatoes?

### How do potatoes potate?

Batteries are pretty simple in their functioning, and essentially only require 3 components: an *anode* (-), a *cathode*(+), and some sort of *electrolyte* solution. Without going into great detail, the anode and cathode are two pieces of metal that react with the electrolyte. The anode (-) oxidizes, releasing two electrons, which are then snapped up by the cathode (+) through a piece of conductive material, such as a wire. This continues until the anode dissolves and the cathode corrodes, at which point the reaction will cease to continue.

The reason why a potato-cell works, is because the mildly acidic potato juice acts as as surprisingly decent electrolyte--all you need are two electrodes, and it will supply you with DC power.

### Charging a Phone

Modern smartphones use Lithium-Ion batteries, usually with a storage capacity of around 2000-3000mAh. For the purposes of this thought experiment, we're assuming that you have a new Galaxy s9, with a 3000mAh battery. Interestingly enough, these batteries can be charged even with very little current, as long as the charging circuit is supplied with constant 5V DC. It would be more practical however, if we could charge it within 24 hours.

$$ \frac{5V * 3000mah}{5V * C ma} = 24 $$ <\br>
$$ C = 125ma $$

Thus, theoretically we should be able to charge the phone in 24 hours if our potato bank can supply 5V 125ma.


### Potatoes

Remembering that voltage stacks in series, and current in parallel, all we need is some quick envelope math to determine how many potatoes would be necessary to satisfy out 5V 125ma requirements.

Online research suggests that potatoes with zinc-copper electrodes supply a nominal voltage of approximately 0.82V, and nominal current of 1.96ma.

*Voltage*
To get the required voltage, we simply divide $$5V / 0.82V = 6.1$$ potatoes in series, rounded up to 7.

*Current*
To get the required current, we divide $$125ma / 1.96ma = 63.8$$, rounded up to 64 parallel cells.

**In the end, this means that we require 64 sets of 7 series-wired potatoes, for a grand total of 448.**
