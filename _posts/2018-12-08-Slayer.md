What if it were possible to (hypothetically) overthrow the top 2000 using a couple of python scripts running in tandem, and in doing so start the new year off with something different?


For nearly 20 years now, the NPO2's top 2000 marathon radio program has been a staple of a Dutch new year's eve. Remarkably,
last year's edition was listened to by **11.3 million** people, or some 76% of the population aged 10 or older. In comparison, the King's 2017 christmas address drew a mere million viewers.

The mere suggestion of manipulating the results of this list drew a good friend to describe it as a sacred national institution, and that anything of the sort would be akin to high treason.



Don't get me wrong, the idea behind the top 2000 is pretty compelling and wholesome, but to be frank, the top of this list has met with little variation since it's inception. Indeed, anyone who knows anything about this list, knows that Queen's *Bohemian Rhapsody* has been in the number 1 spot almost every single time, otherwise taking second place. This being the crown jewel of repetition, the top 10 is otherwise populated by songs that you also loved to hear, the first 14 times you heard them. Such hotel-lobby bangers as *Hotel California*, *Piano Man*, and *November Rain* all tend to come back, year after year.

Enter Slayer. A band whose reputation precedes it as one of the heaviest, fastest, and most sonically abraisive acts in modern music. Celebrated by metalheads of all cultures and origins as one of the groups to have established the thrash metal movement, their music has inspired an entire generation of musicians, and united lovers of heavy music all over the globe.


Why not try and take the #1 spot away from Freddie, and see if we could celebrate everything Slayer has done in the year that they choose to hang up their guitars?



## Goals and Requirements

The plan had a simple goal: vote as many times as ~~humanly~~ possible for the Slayer song "Angel of Death", with the hope of cracking the top 10. Since time is short, and I'm not completely aware of the internal anti-botting measures in place on the voting website, I decided to use the [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) web-driver to autonomously steer a  browser into doing my bidding, and enter information into the fields of my choosing. The main goal of this project was to help me brush up on a bit of python, since actually putting this into action (god forbid it worked) would be a gross violation of the ToC and possibly illegal.

The top 2000 voting schema works as follows:

1. Vote for a minimum of 5 songs of your choosing
2. Enter your motivation for choosing said songs (optional)
3. Enter your full name and e-mail address
4. Accept the ToC and complete a reCAPTCHA

At this point, the first challenges present themselves.

- We need to vote for 4 other songs, if we choose the same ones each time, then they will get an equal number of votes. Also, we should probably randomize Slayer's position in the order to be more inconspicuous.
- We need a bunch of generic names, as well as email addresses
- We need to find a way to circumvent the CAPTCHA
- The script needs to execute in as little time as possible, such that it can complete as often as possible.

First off though, we need to set up the webdriver.

## Set-up

To get started, we imported the relevant packages and initialised the webdriver to work with firefox.

~~~py
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.action_chains import ActionChains

from random import *
import csv
import os
import time

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests


driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get("https://stem.nporadio2.nl/top2000/1")
~~~

The Selenium webdriver allows you to call all sorts of actions on elements on a webpage. In order to do this, you need to provide it with the location of the element that you want to manipulate. This can be by searching through HTML tags based on class or id, but I have found using XPath to be the quickest for the selection of specific elements on a page.

To find the XPath of an object on a webpage, simply inspect it in your browser. Firefox and Chrome both provide a handy copy XPath option that allows you to jam it directly into a *find_element_by_xpath* in your code. As an example, clicking a button would look something like this:

~~~py
driver.find_element_by_xpath("XPATH_TO_BUTTON").click()
~~~

## Voting & Selecting songs

The initial voting procedure is relatively simple--we are required to select a minimum of 5 songs from an interactive applet. The window has a search field, as well as a random selection of popular choices that populates the search results area when no query is entered.

This essentially comes down to instructing Selenium to manipulate the browser automatically, in the same way that a 'real' voter would otherwise do this by manually. We want to vote for the minimum 5 songs, of which one will be *Angel of Death*.

~~~py
#Voting

#Randomly select position of slayer
  position = randint(1,5)

  print("Position is " + str(position))   
  #Randomised position of slayer song in the list
  for x in range(1,6):
      #Vote for Slayer
      if x == position:
          #select field and search slayer if position matches x
          driver.execute_script("window.scrollTo(0, 0)")
          time.sleep(wtl)
          driver.find_element_by_xpath(textentry).send_keys("slayer")
          time.sleep(wtl)
          driver.find_element_by_xpath(slayerbtn).click()
          time.sleep(wtl)

          #clear the search field to return the list of default songs
          driver.find_element_by_xpath(textentry).clear()
          time.sleep(wtl)

      #Vote for random song in top of list
      else:
          currentsong = "/html/body/div[1]/div/div/div[3]/div[2]/div/ul/div/div/li[%s]/div/div/div/div/div[3]/button[2]" % (str(x),)

          #if its too far down the list, scroll it into view
          if x >= 3:
              driver.execute_script("window.scrollTo(0, 500)")
          #Vote for the song
          time.sleep(wts)
          #vote for a default song
          driver.find_element_by_xpath(currentsong).click()
          time.sleep(wts)
          print("vote %s was cast" % (x,))
~~~


Some notes on this:
- We need to vote for 4 other songs--obviously not the same ones every time! Luckily, the list of songs that populate the search result field when the search bar is empty seem to be relatively random (or at least don't seem to repeat very often). As such, we can simply choose 4 of these every time to fill out our minimum 5 votes.

- You will notice many blocks in the code below containing *time.sleep(wtl)* or *time.sleep(wts)*. This is a simple function that allows me to tell the browser to wait for a predetermined amount of time. In this case, I have wtl and wts (wait-long and short) set to 1.5 and 0.7 seconds respectively. This is sometimes necessary to allow all elements on a page to load, for example after searching for a song or clicking through to the next form. There are far cleaner ways of doing this, but I was in a hurry to try and get this together in time!

- It might seem somewhat suspicious if our Slayer song comes in the same position (of the 5 songs) each time we vote. Even though they are not ranked, it might alleviate suspicion if it isn't in position *x* each time. The beginning of the function generates a random integer *position* between 1 and 5 inclusive, which will denote the position of *Angel of Death* in our 5 songs. The function then loops through possible positions, either voting for *Angel of Death* or one of the default songs from the list.

- I have pasted all of the necessary XPATHs into a neat little block elsewhere at the top of my code and stored them as strings. These have been referenced in the find_elment calls (e.g. textentry, slayerbtn)

This is essentially how the voting part of the webdriver works. In the [next installment](https://denzilly.github.io/2018/12/22/Slayerpart2/), we will look at how to generate names and emails, as well as plans for the future!
