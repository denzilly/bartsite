This sauce is super easy to throw together, and really takes a falafel burger to the next level. Way better than pre-fab garlic sauce!

Examples of good pairings:
- Falafel (burgers)
- Lebanese meatballs
- Mediterranean rice dishes

Prep time: 10 minutes

**Ingredients**

- 2-3 cloves of garlic
- 1/2 cucumber
- bunch of Dill
- 500ml full fat Yoghurt
- 1 Lemon


1. Find a nice bowl to make your sauce in. Pour in all of the yoghurt.
2. Peel, and press your garlic into the yoghurt. If you don't have a garlic press, chop it finely and then mash it with the back of a spoon. (Or a clean hammer, I guess, if we're being creative.)
3. Grate half of a cucumber into the yoghurt mixture.
4. Add your dill, as well as the juice of half the lemon.
5. Stir the mixture thoroughly, season with some salt. Play with the level of salt and lemon until you reach a level of tanginess you like, without over-salting or making everything too sour.
