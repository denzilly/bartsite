Straight up, I first made this recipe to try and impress someone. Beyond its vain inspiration however, it ended up leading to a miniature revolution in my culinary life, getting me out of a rut in which I had been rotating through a number of tired classics. Since it's a hell of a lot of work, I highly recommend inviting a sous-chef/buddy  and a bottle or two of pinot to help you on your quest.

Feeds: 4-6 People (4 Burly dudes, or 6 mixed company)
Prep-time: 3-4 Hours

**Ingredients**

- 250g Mushrooms of your choosing (I usually use chestnut(castagne))
- 1 Pumpkin or Squash 500-800g
- 2 Stalks of celery
- 2 Onions
- 2 Carrots
- 800g of canned plum tomatoes (get the good quality ones, non-chopped!)
- 500g beans (borlotti, cannelini, or kidney in a pinch)
- 1 eggplant ca. 500g
- 100g Baby spinach
- Box of lasagna sheets
- 150g block of parmesan cheese (or 100g + 100g mozzarella slices if you have some)
- 100g herry tomatoes
- 100ml red wine
- Couple cloves of garlic (3-5, depending on size, and how cool you are)
- 500ml Creme fraiche
- 1 Tsp Fennel seeds
- Bunch "Woody" italian herbs (rosemary, thyme, sage)
- 1 bay leaf
- Chili flakes



**Method**

To give you an idea of the overall structure, this recipe essentially consists of 4 parts, which are assembled in the final phase. These are:
- Pumpkin/squash: chunks that are roasted in the oven
- Ratatouille: Vegetable stew of tomato base, essentially your "sauce"
- Mushroom Besciamella: Mushroom and garlic, creamy sauce layer
- Accessories: Lasagna sheets, spinach, cheese, and cherry tomatoes on top.


1. Pre-heat the oven to 180Â°C.

2. Cut your pumpkin or squash in half (after giving it a good rinse), and scoop out all of the seeds. Chop it into thick chunks, and spread these out on an oven tray. Drizzle on some olive oil, then add your fennel seeds, salt, pepper, and some chili flakes. You might want to be a bit careful with the fennel, as they can overpower the rest of the herbs if overdone. Put the tray in the oven for about an hour, or until the chunks are golden and have softened up a bit.

3. To make the ratatouille, brown the onions and 2/3rds of the garlic in a generous pour of olive oil in a big saucepan. Subsequently, add the chopped carrots and celery, leaving this to fry on medium heat for about 15 minutes.    

4. Add your "woody" herbs to the vegetable mixture (*save a few sprigs, though*), and pour in the red wine that you hopefully haven't drunk yet. You now also want to add your tomatoes. Instead of chopping your canned (whole) tomatoes, scrunch them one-by-one through your (washed) hands, straight into the pan. (Imagine squeezing a stress-ball, or crushing the hopes and dreams of your mortal nemeses.) Add about 800ml water, and leave this mixture to cook away on medium heat.

5. After cooking for 30 minutes, add your beans. Keep an eye on the water level, adding if it's reducing too quickly. Let this cook for another 30 minutes with the beans, while you work on the aubergine.

6. Split your aubergine in half, length-ways. In search of that sweet grill action, use some tongs to hold your aubergine halves over an open flame (gas stove on max heat). Rotate evenly, to make sure that they become soft and lightly blackened on all sides (this can take a few minutes).

- After grilling, put the halves in a little bowl, covered in aluminum foil or plastic wrap, to cool down for 5 minutes. Then, use a spoon to scrape out all of the juicy flesh, dumping it into your saucepan with the rest of your vegetables.

- Note: If you don't have a gas stove, you can also put the halves on a grill tray in the oven at high heat for 5-8 minutes, depending on softness.

7. Season your ratatouille to taste, and continue adding water/reducing for as long as you like on low heat. I usually like to keep this bad boy going for at least 90 minutes.


8. To make the besciamella, start by slicing your mushrooms. Then, in a small saucepan, fry the leftover garlic for about a minute, subsequently adding the mushrooms and leftover herb along with some salt and pepper. Fry for a few minutes, until the mushrooms are golden brown.

9. Turn the heat on your mushroom mixture down, and slowly stir in the creme fraiche, as well as about half of your block of parmesan (finely grated). Gently cook this mixture on low heat for a few more minutes, whilst stirring.


9. Bloody hell, nearly there! You've made it to the assembly phase. Get a (few) big oven tray(s) and start layering the ingredients in the following order:
  - Ratatouille on the bottom
  - Layer of Besciamella
  - A few chunks of pumpkin/squash
  - Layer of spinach
  - Lasagna sheets


  You might have to play with the amounts a bit, but I can usually get 2.5-3 layers in a medium-deep oven dish. Top it off with a layer of grated parmesan (and mozzarella, if you have it. Really, any tasty cheese is a bonus.) and sprinkle on your halved cherry tomatoes.

10. Bake for 45 minutes (or until done), as you stare longingly into the oven window.

 Its hazy, warm glow acting as what seems like an interdimensional flavour portal, open only to release the savoury odours of the ingredients you just lovingly combined into what is soon to be, a fucking great lasagna.
