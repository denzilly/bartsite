This type of curry was considered sacrosanct in our family home, yet we never tried to make it ourselves for fear of the complicated process and not being able to do it justice. Recently however, I received the gift of some delicious curry powder straight from India, and believe to have managed to do an amicable job of replicating this classic! If you don't have any great curry powder on hand, you can make your own basic approximation by substituting the following whenever curry powder is mentioned in the recipe.

- 2 Parts garam masala
- 1 Part ground cumin
- 1 Part ground turmeric

**Ingredients for 2-3**

*For the marinade:*
- 400g Boneless chicken fillet
- 150ml Full fat yoghurt
- 3 Cloves of minced garlic
- 1/2 Tablespoon chopped ginger
- 3 Teaspoons chicken tikka masala curry powder
- 1/2 Teaspoon chili powder, or 1 chopped red chili
- 1/2 Teaspoon salt

*For the sauce:*
- 1 Tablespoon vegetable oil (olive does just fine too)
- 1 Tablespoon butter
- 1 Onion, diced
- 1 Tablespoon garlic, finely chopped or grated
- 3 Teaspoons chicken tikka masala curry powder
- 0.5 Teaspoons ground coriander
- 200g Passata or tomato puree
- 100ml double cream (creme fraiche)
- Chili (powder) to taste
- 0.5 Teaspoon brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- A bit of fresh coriander for garnishing

- 75g Rice, per person

**Method**

1. First we need to make a marinade. Chop the chicken into bite sized pieces (size of your thumb beyond the last knuckle), and put this in a bowl with all of the marinade ingredients as listed above. Cover and let this marinate in the fridge for half an hour (or as long as possible, overnight is even better).

2. Boil some water and get your rice cooking. Since there are many types of rice and associated procedures, I'm leaving you to your own devices here--the rest of the recipe focuses on the curry! Don't forget to check on your rice later.

3. Heat some oil in a big pan, I like to use a work for this. On medium-high heat, fry the chicken until browned on both sides (approx 3 mins or so). Once cooked, take the chicken out and put it aside.

4. Melt the butter in the same pan you used for the chicken, fry the onion until soft and clear, and scrape any residue from frying the chicken into the mix.

5. Saut√© the ginger and garlic for 1 minute, then add the curry powder and coriander. Stir this all up for another half minute or so.

6. Add the tomato puree, salt, and chili should you decide to use more. Let this simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring regularly. The sauce should thicken up appreciably.

7. Add the cream and sugar, as well as the cooked chicken, back into the sauce. Stir regularly and allow to cook for an additional 8-10 minutes. If you followed the steps thusfar, your kitchen should smell divine.

8. Serve the curry with rice, garnishing with a sprig of coriander leaf.
