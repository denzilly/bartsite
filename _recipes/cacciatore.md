Apparently, Italy has more to offer than just Pizza and Pasta--Cacciatore is one o fthose things

**Ingredients**

- 2-3 cloves of garlic
- 1/2 cucumber
- bunch of Dill
- 500ml full fat Yoghurt
- 1 Lemon


1. Find a nice bowl to make your sauce in. Pour in all of the yoghurt.
2. Peel, and press your garlic into the yoghurt. If you don't have a garlic press, chop it finely and then mash it with the back of a spoon. (Or a clean hammer, I guess, if we're being creative.)
3. Grate half of a cucumber into the yoghurt mixture.
4. Add your dill, as well as the juice of half the lemon.
5. Stir the mixture thoroughly, season with some salt. Play with the level of salt and lemon until you reach a level of tanginess you like, without over-salting or making everything too sour.
